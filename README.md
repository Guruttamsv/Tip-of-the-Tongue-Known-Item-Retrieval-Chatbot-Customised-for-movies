Before Running this project, it is required to create an environment(conda preferred if local system, so replace pip with conda) and install some packages.
Ill mention the bash code commands for the:

pip install langchain 
pip install transformers 
pip install llama-index
huggingface-cli login (for this you will need a hugginface token with permission to use necessary models)
pip install accelerate
pip install bitsandbytes
pip install wikipedia
pip3 install wikipedia-api

This project will require high GPU power, if running it on google collab make sure to turn runtime to GPU.
